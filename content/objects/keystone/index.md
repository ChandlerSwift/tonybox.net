summary: "A bracket for mounting two keystone modules, like cat6 jacks, to the wall."
---

This is a simple bracket that I designed in Fusion 360 to mount a couple of keystone modules to the wall in the basement, since having the wires dangling didn't look good.  Printed in relatively low quality, on PLA, vertically on a FlashForge Creator Pro (screw holes down), 15% infill, 0.3mm layer height.
