A group of my friends have a "cooking club" facebook group, where we write up things that we have cooked.  I'm not very good at cooking, so I wrote up a satirical guide to cooking ramen noodles.  This did not technically violate any of the rules of we set for the club.

1. Obviously, locally source your ramen noodles. In my case, I locally sourced my ramen noodle packet at the Duane Reade on 3rd Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Street in New York City. Duane Reades are well known for selling ramen noodle packets, among other items.

2. When selecting a packet, gently squeeze the ramen noodle packet to make sure that the noodles inside aren't cracked. The ideal ramen noodle packet should have a thin, soft plastic skin, with a hard skeleton of noodles inside. If it feels like there are bits of detached noodle, then put that packet down and get another one. If you squeeze too hard and hear a crunch, place your packet in the back of the shelf and get a new one. Don't worry, nobody saw you.

3. Carefully transport the noodles back to your cooking site. I transported mine using the New York City Subway System - a fast and efficient system like this is essential to getting your noodles to your cooking site before they go bad or you give up and eat something else.

4. Your cooking site will need the following equipment, which can be found in any dumpster: something to heat water, like an electric kettle, or a bowl-shaped rock and a lighter/blowtorch; something to hold the noodles and the water, like a bowl, or a second bowl-shaped rock; and a spoon, like the one that guy is using to do heroin with that lighter.

5. You've heard of farm-to-table, but what you may not know about this trend is that there is usually an intermediate step where the food is prepared in a kitchen. I guess farm-to-kitchen-to-table doesn't have the same ring to it. In our case, we are going to skip that intermediate step and go for the real thing by preparing our noodles on the table.

6. Place the bowl on the table. Use the water-heating apparatus from earlier to heat some water to its boiling point. Pour this water into your bowl. I know this is already step six, but don't worry, you're almost there! By now, you've already got a bowl on your table containing hot liquid, so you can surely see the light at the end of the tunnel.

7. Carefully open your ramen noodle packet. I recommend using your teeth. If you don't have teeth, or don't want to risk them, you can use your fingers, a blade, a bandsaw, or a plasma cutter to open the packet. While you may be tempted, do not try and open the packet using your spoon - itâ€™ll just damage the noodles inside, and possibly the spoon as well.

8. Inside you will find a chunk of dried noodles, and a second, smaller packet, which is called the "child packet." The child packet contains a mixture of powdered chicken, salt, and despair. You'll want to hold on to the child packet, we're going to use it later.

9. Break off an appropriately sized chunk of dried noodles and place them in your bowl with the hot water - be careful, if you touch the hot water, you might burn yourself. Let the noodles float in the water for a bit.

10. Once the noodles have been in there for a few minutes and the water is appropriately cloudy, start to hit at them with a spoon or other hitting implement, like your fingers. Be careful not to break the noodles - you only need to separate them out from each other a bit.

11. I hope you held on to the child packet, because now we're going to use it. Simply rip the child packet apart, spilling powder everywhere. Don't worry, we're only going to use about half of the powder from the child packet, so whatever spilled out can just be left on the table, or used to cut cocaine to give it some more punch, if you're into that sort of thing.

12. Place the remaining powder into the bowl - try to use only half the powder, if you use too much it will become too powerful and possibly dangerous. Stir the concoction with your spoon or finger, and chant the following: "OH GREAT LORD RAMEN, TOUCH US WITH YOUR NOODLY APPENDAGE."  

13. Rapidly consume the noodles and the accompanying liquid like the animal you are. Congratulations, and enjoy your well-earned soup-like dinner.
